Elemets of STL

- Containers (Collection fo obejcts or primitive types)
    - Array
    - Vector
    - Deque
    - Stack
    - Set
    - Map

- Algortihms (Functions for processing sequences of elements frmo containers)
    - Find
    - Max
    - Count
    - Accumulate
    - Sort

- Iterators (Generate sequences of element from containers)
    - Forward
    - Reverse
    - By Value
    - By Reference
    - Constant


TYPES OF CONTAINERS 

Sequence Containers (Maintain the order of elements)
    - Array
    - Vector
    - List 
    - Forward_List
    - Deque

Associative Containers (Insert elements in a predefined order or no order at all)
    - Set (cannot have any duplicates)
    - Map (like a dictionary where a word is associated with its definition)

Container Adapters (Variations of the other containers)
        *Does not support algorithms


TYPES OF ITERATORS
Input Iterators - from the container to the Program
Output Iterators - from the program to the container
Forward Iterators - navigate one item at a time in one direction
Bi-directional Iterators - navigate one item at a time both directions
Random access Iterators - directly access a container item

TYPES OF ALGORITHMS
    - Non-modifying
    - Modifying


##############################################################################

SETS:
- no duplicates
- ordered automatically


MAPS:
    - elements are stored as Key and Value pairs (std::pair)
    - ordered by key 
    - no duplicate elements (keys are unique)
    - elements are accessed directly using the key
