/* generate a valid number:
    - each digit ranging from 0-9
    - left-most digit cannot be zero
    - each digit appears ONLY ONCE

    GENERATING VALID NUMBER ###
    1. generate random number (input <-r><length of number>)
    2. user provides a number (input <-u><secret number>)
        *length of number starts from 0 index

    GUESSING THE NUMBER
    1. User guesses a number
    2. Program provides two number
        1st num: amount of correctly guessed digits in the right place
        2nd num: amount of correctly guessed digits in the wrong place
    3. Continue the program until the user enters the correct number

    FOUND NUMBER
    - Program informs the user that they found the number and
      says in how many iterations the user was able to guess the number
      (iterations start from 1)

    POSSIBLE ERRORS:
    - Missing parameter
    - Wrong parameter ###
    - Undefined parameter ###
    - Invalid secret number entered by user ###
    - Negative value ###
    - 0 value following the -r option ###

    QUESTIONS::::
    SHOULD I DO ERROR CHECKING FOR THE GUESSING PORTION OF THE GAME?
    I.E. SHOULD IT LET THE USER GUESS AGAIN IF THEY ENTER "1212"?
