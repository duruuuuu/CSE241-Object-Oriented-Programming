ENCAPSULATION
	- Means "bringing together as one:

	- Declare a class -> get an object

	- Object is "encapsulation" of:
		- Data Values
		- Operations on the data

Principles of OOP
- Information Hiding
	- Details of how operations work not known to "user" of class

- Data Abstraction
	- Details of how data is manipulated within ADT/classes not known to user

- Encapsulation
	- Bringing together data and operations, but keep "details" hidden 

Public and Private Data MEmbers
- Data in classes almost always designated private in definiton!

- Public items (usually member functions) are all "user-accessible"

Accessor and Mutator Functions
- Allows objects to manipulate private entities

Separate Interface and Implementation


Thinking Objects
- Focus for programming changes
	Before -> algorithms center stage
	OOP    -> data is focus

- Algo still exists
	- Theys simply focus on their d ata
	- Are "made" to "fit" the data


CONSTRUCTORS AND OTHER TOOLS
- Initialization of objects
- Automatically called when the member is decalred
-
