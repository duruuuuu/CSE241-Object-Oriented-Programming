!!! Check if iflename construcctor for Image class works
!!! Check dimensions constructorand check if you can open a new image w it as well

questions:
- can i use my pixel class instead of a struct? assuming yes.
- for the function that returns individual pixel info, does it return just one color channel
  or all of the color in the pixel?
- wtf is the () operator supposed to do exactly????
    int c = image1(row, col, r/g/b)
